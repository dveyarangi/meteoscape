# Data model — domains, coverages, parameters

The concrete encoding of everything that flows through the [algebra](./0001-manifold-algebra-and-composition.md):
the **`Domain` / `Selection`** (the *where*), the **`Coverage` / `ParameterData`** (the data), and the
**parameter** itself (the *what* — quantity, statistic, extent). It records the encoding so v1's
concrete types can be built with the right **slots reserved**, even where v1 fills only the degenerate
case. The provenance plane a `Coverage` carries is owned by
[ADR-0003](./0003-provenance-and-origin.md); how producers are matched and resolved is
[ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md).

## Domain & Selection

- **`Domain` is an interface; representations vary behind it.** A `Domain` is an abstract coordinate set
  over the **4 axes** (3 spatial + `valid_time`) whose **universal** surface is just the set-algebra —
  `contains` / `intersect` (the Capability filter) — with **nothing in it assuming the axes are
  separable**. **Enumeration is the `EnumerableDomain` refinement** (`enumerate` / index / `len`), so
  *being* one is the enumerability discriminator — a continuous `region` Domain never claims it. v1 ships
  two representations; the interface admits richer ones with no contract change:
  - **`RegularDomain`** — a `RegularAxis` per axis (cells generated from origin + step + count: the
    uniform lattice).
  - **`FootprintDomain`** — a **continuous**, separable provider reach (never enumerable): per-axis
    bounds — a `ContinuousAxis` on each spatial / Z axis, a clock-anchored `RollingAxis` on `valid_time`
    (`extent = [A, A + max_lead]` around the run anchor `A` — the provider's cadence model,
    [ADR-0003](./0003-provenance-and-origin.md)). `contains` composes per-axis
    extent-containment and is therefore **clock-relative** — the one intentional exception to
    Domain-as-pure-geometry, isolated to this representation — so the Capability filter tracks a rolling
    horizon while `serves` stays a plain `contains`
    ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md) /
    [#18](../concerns.md#18-clock-anchored-footprint-fidelity)).
  - **`RectilinearDomain`** — explicit per-axis `EnumerableAxis`es of stored `Cell`s (separable but
    irregular).
  - **`CurvilinearDomain`** — non-separable geometry (radar geotangent slice, satellite swath).
    *Room left, not built* ([#12](../concerns.md#12-curvilinear-domains)).

- **Separability is a facet; enumerability and regularity are per-axis choices.** Mirroring the
  algebra's *capabilities, not subtypes*: per-axis decomposition is the one optional facet a
  **separable** representation exposes — its per-axis `Axis`. An **`Axis` mirrors `Domain`**: its
  universal surface is a span (`extent`), and **enumeration is the `EnumerableAxis` refinement** — a lazy
  `Sequence[Cell]` (`axis[i] -> Cell`, `len`). Regularity is a choice *within* an enumerable axis: a
  `RegularAxis` generates its cells from `(anchor, step, count)` and stays snappable; an explicit one
  stores them. Whether a `RegularAxis` generates **bounded** cells (each spanning one step,
  `bounds = [coord, coord + step]`) or bare **instants** (`bounds = None`) is its **`cellular`** flag — the
  generative counterpart of a `Cell`'s optional `bounds`: it is how the shared `valid_time` axis emits the
  hourly `bounds` an **extensive** parameter reads as its accumulation extent, while an intensive parameter
  samples the tick and ignores them. A **continuous** axis carries only its bound — a plain `ContinuousAxis` or a clock-anchored
  `RollingAxis` (the `FootprintDomain`'s axes). Curvilinear domains satisfy the base interface without
  being separable. **Only a regular axis can be snapped-to.**

- **Mode is the Domain's shape, not a separate field** — `region` / `snapped` / `exact` are *which kind
  of Domain* you built, so **`Selection = Domain + parameters`** (no redundant `mode` field that could
  disagree with the Domain):
  - **Continuous** (`region`) — bounds, no discretization → projects to a **field**.
  - **Snapped** — regular **step** fixed, anchor / extent open → resolvable against a declared grid.
  - **Enumerable** (`exact`) — concrete coordinate set (regular-anchored or irregular point set) →
    `Countable` result.

- **One regular descriptor unifies snapped / declared-grid / exact.** A regular lattice is
  `{anchor, step, extent}`; its members differ only in which parts are fixed — **Snapped** fixes `step`
  (+ request bounds), a **declared grid** fixes `anchor + step` (extent open), an **exact** lattice
  fixes all three. So a declared grid is just the **anchored-regular member** — **provider-exact where a
  vendor declares a lattice, a configured guess for point vendors that expose none** — and the read-back
  resolution `snapped → exact = step(request) ⊕ anchor(grid) ⊕ bounds(request)` keeps **`bounds(request)`**.
- **Grid alignment is per-`Countable` node, and splits into two opposite-extent steps.** A `Countable`
  `Reservoir`'s `Store` **`quantize`s** a request for **retention** — snaps the requested axes onto the
  declared grid **and widens the extent outward to whole assimilable units**, so the retrieval shape
  **encloses** the request (extent **≥** request; the rounding is the store lattice's own business). At
  **read** the `Reservoir` **homogenizes** the stored cells back onto the requested `Domain` — extent
  **=** request (`snapped → exact` above) — so `project(sel)` always returns a Coverage on `sel.domain`
  ([ADR-0001](./0001-manifold-algebra-and-composition.md)). Resolving to the caller's exact output is the
  **read-back, not the `Store`'s job**; the two steps move extent in **opposite directions** (quantize
  widens past the request, read-back crops back to it). The per-axis snap is `quantize`'s internal
  mechanism (no standalone operation): an open-anchor regular axis borrows the grid's anchor (the
  `valid_time` case), a **concrete coordinate snaps to its nearest grid node** (the lat/lon case);
  `issue_time` is not requested, so it is never snapped. A request's **mode** (Snapped vs Enumerable) may
  be resolved at the edge, but **internal nodes are handed enumerable (store-shaped) Selections**, never
  Snapped. The canonical lattice is **emergent per node**; there is no global lattice config.

- **`issue_time` is a provenance stamp, not a Domain axis.** The per-Coverage / per-request `Domain`
  has **4 interpolable axes** (3 spatial + `valid_time`); `issue_time` (the forecast issuance a value
  came from) is **never interpolated, never snapped, never in a request**, so it is **not** a coordinate
  the caller navigates — it is **run identity carried on the atomic `Origin`**
  ([ADR-0003](./0003-provenance-and-origin.md)) and the basis of freshness (run currency).
  The 4 axes are therefore all **field axes** (resamplable dimensions); **no categorical axis sits in
  the core**. Whether a given *parameter* may be resampled along an axis is its **resampler** fact (its
  `scale`; see *Parameters*), not an axis property. The **categorical-key mechanism** (select / group,
  never interpolate) survives as a **collection-layer seam** — the home of `issue_time` *archives* and future
  **ensemble / scenario** keys — not a core field axis. **Cross-run combination** is then a **reconciler
  folding run-stamped contributor Coverages along `valid_time`**
  ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)), yielding a synthetic origin — *not* an
  axis to interpolate.

- **The vertical (Z) axis carries one `vertical_reference`; the coordinate stays a plain scalar.** Z is one
  of the 3 spatial axes — an ordinary field axis of `Cell`s whose `coordinate` is a plain scalar like every
  other axis — and the **`vertical_reference` is an attribute of the Z *axis* representation** (one per
  Domain, since a Domain carries one Z axis), **not** part of the coordinate. The reference is one of
  **`above_ground`** (datum = the terrain surface; the home of near-surface offsets like 2 m / 10 m),
  **`isobaric`** (pressure levels), **`height_above_msl`**. These references are **not linearly comparable**
  — `2 m above_ground` and `1000 hPa` relate only through physics (surface pressure, hydrostatics) — so a
  single Domain's Z axis carries **one** reference, and **stacking references is a `Calculator`** (a
  reinterpolation), never a free axis read.
  *(Amends the original `(reference, value)` pair-coordinate framing — see
  [Considered options](#considered-options): the reference is axis-level, so `Coordinate` stays
  `float | datetime` and only the Z-axis representation grows a field.)*

- **Level vs layer is the `Cell`'s `bounds`, like everywhere else.** A thin Z `Cell` (`bounds = None`)
  is a single level / offset; a **fat** Z `Cell` carries `bounds` spanning a layer — `[~0, 10 m]
  above_ground` (the near-surface layer) or `[1000, 850] hPa`. A near-surface request *is* that fat cell:
  `temperature` (2 m) and `wind_u` (10 m) both land in it, each contributing its native near-surface
  value, the differing offsets **absorbed into the cell's `bounds`** ("vertically unresolved across the
  layer") — not a wasteful multi-level Domain with a sparse `present` mask. The cell's `coordinate`
  (a nominal near-surface height) sits *within* those `bounds` by convention, the same independence
  every axis's `Cell` already has. Projecting onto a Z cell is vertical **homogenization** — the exact
  analog of the temporal / spatial kernel; coarsening to a fat cell absorbs offsets, sampling to a thin
  cell interpolates (extent-scaling–aware).

- **Resampling a parameter onto an axis is its `resampler`, entailed by `(scale, statistic,
  extent_scaling)` and asymmetric.** **Refine up** follows the measurement **scale** — `linear`
  interpolates to any tick, `circular` is angular, categorical fills / snaps; **coarsen down** follows
  the **statistic** — whole, phase-aligned integer-multiple aggregation (`sum` for extensive,
  `max` / `min` / `mean` for windowed), never disaggregation. So interpolability is a **parameter**
  fact, not an axis one. The matching half (does a **lossless** path exist) lives with Capability
  ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)); the kernel **implementations** (a
  registry, the mirror of reconcilers) and any **lossy** tier stay deferred
  ([#5](../concerns.md#5-read-time-homogenization-fidelity), [#7](../concerns.md#7-quality-scoring)).

## Coverage & ParameterData

- **A Coverage carries its Domain, its `capability`, and values positional to the Domain.** `Coverage
  = (EnumerableDomain, Capability, {parameter: ParameterData}, ProvenanceField)` — the Coverage
  *contains* the one `EnumerableDomain` (so it is a re-projectable `Manifold`), its **`capability`**
  (the `ParameterDef` per parameter × that Domain — the self-describing **descriptor block**, capability
  being exactly parameters × Domain), one
  `ParameterData` per parameter, and a `provenance` plane (below); `values[i]` is the value at the i-th
  `Point` of `domain.enumerate()`. **No coordinates are duplicated** in a `ParameterData` ("a Coverage
  is a Selection filled with data," literally); in-memory packing (N-D vs flat, dtype, order) is
  deliberately unspecified. The per-parameter element is **`ParameterData`**, not "range" — that reads
  as an interval, colliding with a `Cell`'s `bounds`. `capability` / `ranges` / `provenance` share one
  parameter key set.

- **`ParameterData` is pure numbers `(values, present)`; every descriptor is id-entailed.** The slice
  does **not** restate its own `ParameterId` (the `ranges` map key) and carries **no** descriptors at
  all. Under the **canonical-mono-unit invariant** (*Parameters* below) every fact that interprets the
  numbers — `quantity`, `extent_scaling`, `unit`, `statistic` — is *entailed by the parameter's
  identity*, so it has exactly one home, the `ParameterDef`. A tableless reader interprets the slice
  through the Coverage's own **`capability`** (`capability.served[pid][0].canonical_unit` /
  `.statistic` / `.quantity` / `.extent_scaling`); the global `ParameterTable` is not needed at read. This
  mirrors CoverageJSON, where a `range` carries minimal value facts and the `parameters` block carries
  the descriptors — here those descriptors **travel with** the Coverage inside its `capability`.

- **The descriptor block is carried, not resolved.** A Coverage is **self-describing**: it embeds its
  `capability` (the `ParameterDef` per parameter × Domain) so a stored / serialized / inter-node Coverage
  interprets standalone without the injected `ParameterTable` — the same `(parameters × Domain)` shape as a
  `Selection` and a `Capability` clause set. The descriptors are id-entailed canonical facts, so there
  is no per-slice denormalization to drift out of sync; the block is the one place they ride.

- **Nodata is an explicit per-parameter mask.** `present: Sequence[bool] | None`, positional to
  `values`: `present[i] is False` ⇒ **nodata** at that point (a *successful* gap — 0 contributors, not a
  fault, [ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)); `present is None` ⇒ all cells
  present (the elided common case). An explicit boolean mask — **not** a NaN sentinel — because it is
  dtype-agnostic (categorical / integer parameters can't carry NaN) and keeps "no data" distinct from a
  legitimate not-a-number value. Per-parameter, since each parameter's coverage footprint differs.

- **A parameter's extent → the optional `bounds` on each axis `Cell`.** An axis is a `Sequence[Cell]`,
  and a `Cell` pairs its representative `coordinate` with optional `bounds: Interval`; `bounds is None` ⇒
  the coordinate is an **instant / point**. The two are independent — the `coordinate` sits within the
  `bounds` by convention (centre, or an edge for period-ending accumulations), never by definition. It
  generalizes to all axes uniformly (a spatial cell is the product of per-axis intervals). Cells live on
  the **`Separable` facet**, not the base `Domain` (non-separable per-cell bounds are the deferred
  curvilinear case). So the statistic / integration window for `values[i]` — an extensive parameter's **extent** — is
  the shared `valid_time` axis cell's `bounds`, stated **once** on the Domain, read by every parameter.

- **Provenance is a Coverage-level plane, owned by [ADR-0003](./0003-provenance-and-origin.md).** Not a
  `ParameterData` attribute: origin varies over **two** axes — **parameter** (the Arbiter picks a source
  per parameter) and **geometry point** (a mosaic differs per cell) — so it is a `ProvenanceField` on
  the `Coverage`, peer to `domain` and `ranges`, indexed `at(parameter, i)` with `summary(parameter)`
  the O(1) per-parameter freshness handle. Keeping it off the slice is what lets the Arbiter assemble
  one Coverage from many single-origin sources without rewriting each slice.

## Parameters — quantity, statistic, extent

- **Quantity is the identity root, carrying an `extent_scaling`.** A parameter's identity root is a
  physical field — its **quantity** — whose **`extent_scaling ∈ {intensive, extensive}`** is its
  relationship to a cell's temporal extent, and sets which statistics are meaningful:
  - **Intensive** — instantaneous, **extent-independent** (temperature, rain-rate, pressure, wind).
    Window statistics apply; **extent optional**.
  - **Extensive** — **additive**, the value is the **integral over the cell extent** (precipitation,
    snowfall, radiant energy). **Extent required**; values sum across adjacent cells.
  `extent_scaling` is not a units claim: rain-rate `mm/hr` carries a time unit yet is intensive
  (window-independent); precip `mm` carries none yet is extensive (3h > 1h).

- **Measurement scale selects the refine-up resampler.** `Quantity.scale ∈ {linear, circular, nominal,
  ordinal}` — `linear` interpolates / averages, `circular` is angular, categorical scales fill / mode /
  priority. **Wind is canonical as its u/v (eastward / northward) components** — both `linear`, so
  linear interpolation of u/v *is* correct wind interpolation and **speed / direction are derived
  views** (Calculators above u/v), keeping the coupling out of per-parameter resamplers. Every v1
  canonical quantity is `linear`; the non-linear scales are declared-but-unexercised seams.

- **Units are canonical and mono per parameter — the interior is unit-blind.** Each parameter has
  **exactly one** unit, `ParameterDef.canonical_unit`; every value of that parameter, everywhere in the
  algebra, is in that unit. Unit is therefore **id-entailed**, never a navigable degree of freedom: it
  is *not* in the parameter key, *not* in a `Capability` clause (a vendor emitting °F is the same
  parameter, not a different one), and *not* in a `Selection`. Unit conversion happens at **exactly two
  boundaries** — the Provider's **Normalizer** on ingest (vendor unit → canonical, write-time, in the
  data) and the **surface adapter** on egress (canonical → a requested presentation unit, read-time;
  deferred in v1, which returns canonical per [§4](../v1-requirements.md)). In between, the whole tree —
  Capability matching, the Arbiter's fold, Calculators, the `Store` — is **unit-blind**: physics relies
  on the canonical *convention*, never a runtime conversion. The concrete canonical-unit choice per
  parameter is a deferred **parameter convention** ([#10](../concerns.md#10-parameter-conventions)).

- **The two cell axes, split by dimension.** A cell's value statistic is two independent things:
  - **`CellStatistic = point | max | min | mean`** — a **window statistic**, *dimension-preserving*
    (mean temp is K, peak intensity is mm/hr); lives on `ParameterDef`, surfaced via the Coverage's
    `capability` (descriptor block); `point` is the degenerate window (an instant). The Provider's
    Normalizer coerces vendor data to the canonical statistic, so it is not a freely-chosen runtime
    value.
  - **Calculus depth** — *dimension-changing* (`∫ rate dt → accumulation`, `mm/hr·h → mm`); this is the
    quantity `extent_scaling`, **not** a `CellStatistic` value. Accumulation is the **integration edge**
    between an intensive `rate` quantity and its extensive integral (e.g. rain-rate ↔ precipitation) — a
    vocabulary-declared quantity pair, not a third value.

- **Extent never enters the parameter key.** Extent is carried by the Domain's `valid_time` `Cell` `bounds` (above). So the
  **materialized / requested parameter key = `(quantity, statistic)`**; "3h precipitation" = parameter
  `precipitation` over a Domain whose `valid_time` cells are 3h wide — one shared axis serving parameters
  of different temporal meaning.

- **A parameter is a functional `statistic(quantity)`; requests name it explicitly.** The window
  statistic + quantity form the key; the **extent is requested through the Selection's `valid_time`
  cells**, never in the parameter name. Ergonomic **aliases** (e.g. `precip_3h`) are **surface sugar**
  that desugars at the edge into *(parameter `(precipitation, ·)`, valid_time cells = 3h)* — the on-ramp
  to later formula injection, **not** a second identity. v1's surface accepts a bare quantity name =
  `point(quantity)`.

- **An extensive quantity's extent is producer-intrinsic.** Unlike an intensive quantity (resampleable
  to any tick), an extensive quantity has a native extent (period + phase) only coarsenable by aligned
  additivity. That native extent is a **per-parameter Capability fact**
  ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)), carried by the `Store`'s declared grid and
  the returned Coverage's `valid_time` `Cell` `bounds`. A request for an unreachable extent (1h from a 3h
  producer, a shifted phase, instants) is simply **`capability-mismatch`** — no disaggregation machinery.

- **A surface parameter's height is a Domain Z coordinate, not the key — `temperature_2m` is an alias.**
  Like extent, vertical position rides the Domain (its Z `Cell`), never the parameter key:
  `temperature_2m` / `wind_u_10m` are **aliases** desugaring at the edge into *(quantity
  `air_temperature` / `eastward_wind`, statistic `point`, Z = `2 m` / `10 m` above_ground)* — the
  materialized key stays `(quantity, statistic)`. A producer's **native vertical offset** is a
  per-parameter **Capability** fact, exactly parallel to an extensive quantity's native **extent**
  `{period, phase}` ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)): the request's Z cell
  (a fat near-surface layer or a specific level) is matched against it and sampled onto. A 2 m diagnostic
  joined onto a pressure column is the cross-reference `Calculator` (above).

## Why

- One Domain interface with swappable representations keeps the common case (a uniform hourly lattice)
  trivial while leaving curvilinear radar reachable without reshaping consumers — the Arbiter's fold,
  homogenization, and serialization bind to the interface, not a representation.
- Folding mode into the Domain removes a redundant field and makes illegal states unrepresentable; the
  single regular descriptor collapses request-snap / store-grid / exact-lattice into one parameterized
  shape, so snapping is an algebraic combine, not special-case code.
- Putting **extent on the Domain** keeps coordinates in one place and lets a single shared axis serve
  parameters of different temporal meaning; carrying the **`capability`** (its descriptor block) keeps a
  Coverage self-describing without the global `ParameterTable`, which the stateless-Provider /
  store-and-flow model needs — while `ParameterData` stays pure `(values, present)`, so there is no
  id-entailed fact denormalized onto the slice to drift.
- **A canonical-mono-unit interior** collapses unit handling to two edges (Normalizer ingest, surface
  egress) and leaves the entire algebra unit-blind: Capability, the Arbiter's fold, and Calculators
  never negotiate or convert units, so a derived parameter's formula is unit-safe by *convention*.
- **Vertical position on the Domain (not the key)** is the same move as extent: `temperature_2m` is an
  alias, height is a Z `Cell`, and a near-surface bundle of mixed offsets is one **fat** Z cell — so the
  vertical axis reuses the whole `Cell` / `bounds` / Capability apparatus instead of inventing a
  parameter-side height. The 3-D column and pressure-level products are then reachable purely additively
  (materialize the Z axis; cross-reference joins are Calculators).
- **Provenance as a Coverage plane** (not a per-slice field) lets the Arbiter assemble one Coverage from
  many single-origin sources, and a mosaic vary origin per point, without reshaping `ParameterData` —
  while `summary(parameter)` keeps the common per-parameter freshness read O(1).
- **Quantity-as-root + `extent_scaling`** explains *why precipitation differs from temperature* — how the
  value scales with extent (integration depth), not a special enum value — and keeps units honest (the
  dimension change rides the quantity edge, not a cell attribute). Splitting the cell axes stops `sum`
  masquerading as a peer of `max` / `min`: a statistic and an integral are categorically different and
  per-level exclusive over a single extent ("daily max of hourly accumulation" is a two-window calculator
  chain).
- An explicit `present` mask makes partial coverage representable from day one without retrofitting the
  value layout when the first partial producer or coverage reconciler lands.

## Considered options

- **Keep `mode` as an explicit `Selection` field.** Rejected: it restates the Domain shape and the two
  can disagree (a snapped flag on an irregular point set). *(Reversible as a derived accessor.)*
- **A single separable (per-axis product) Domain as the base type.** Rejected: bakes separability into
  the contract, excluding curvilinear geometries; separability is a facet.
- **Keep `issue_time` as a 5th (categorical) axis.** Rejected: it is never interpolated, snapped, or
  requested, so it is a **phantom axis** that double-accounts with the provenance run stamp. Demotion
  keeps **cross-run / forecast-convergence** expressible — cross-run is a **reconciler over run-stamped
  contributors** ([ADR-0004](./0004-producer-resolution-and-capability.md)) and convergence a **derived
  enumerable view** over those contributors, both with `issue_time` as a stamp. The categorical-key
  shape survives as a **collection-layer seam** (archives, ensemble, scenario). *(Reversible: restore the
  axis if a native 2-D `valid_time × issue_time` Coverage is ever wanted.)*
- **The vertical reference as part of the coordinate — `(reference, value)`.** Originally recorded that
  way; **amended**. The reference is one-per-Domain (hence one-per-Z-axis), never varies cell to cell, and
  is never interpolated, so pairing it into every coordinate would tax `Coordinate` (forcing it past
  `float | datetime`) and every axis for a Z-only fact. It moves to an **attribute of the Z-axis
  representation**; coordinates stay plain scalars, and the whole `Cell` / `bounds` apparatus is untouched.
  *(Reversible: restore the pair if a single Domain ever needs to mix references on one axis — but mixed
  references are a `Calculator` today, so the axis carries exactly one.)*
- **A single per-parameter `cell_method` carrying both statistic and extent.** Rejected: duplicates the
  extent into every `ParameterData` and can disagree with the Domain — split extent (Domain) from
  statistic (parameter).
- **Clone descriptors (`unit` / `statistic`) onto `ParameterData`.** Rejected: under the
  canonical-mono-unit invariant these are *id-entailed* canonical facts, identical for every value of
  the parameter — denormalizing them onto each slice is pure redundancy with a drift risk and re-opens
  "why this id-entailed fact on the slice and not `quantity` / `extent_scaling`?". The slice stays pure
  `(values, present)`; the descriptors ride the Coverage's `capability` once.
- **Resolve descriptors from the injected `ParameterTable` instead of carrying them.** Rejected: a
  stored / serialized / inter-node Coverage would not interpret standalone — it would couple every
  reader to the live catalog. Carrying the `capability` (the `(parameters × Domain)` shape a
  `Selection` and a `Capability` already use) makes the Coverage self-describing; it is the link,
  and `ParameterData` never restates its `ParameterId` (the `ranges` map key — restating it invites
  key/value disagreement and diverges from CoverageJSON, where a `range` does not repeat its id).
- **Unit polymorphism inside the algebra (per-slice or requestable units).** Rejected: it would push
  unit awareness into Capability matching, the Arbiter's fold, and every Calculator. Canonicalizing at
  the Provider edge and converting for presentation at the surface edge keeps the interior unit-blind.
- **Provenance as a per-`ParameterData` attribute.** Rejected: origin varies by *both* parameter and
  geometry point, and the Arbiter assembles one Coverage from many sources, so provenance is a
  Coverage-level plane (above), not a field on each slice.
- **NaN sentinel for nodata.** Rejected: only works for float-valued data and conflates "no data" with a
  legitimate not-a-number value.
- **A literal `CellIntegration` peer enum beside `CellStatistic`.** Rejected: integration is
  dimension-changing and per-level-exclusive with window statistics, so it is truer as the quantity
  `extent_scaling` than a per-cell attribute.
- **Extent in the parameter key — `statistic(quantity, extent)`.** Rejected: the Domain already owns extent;
  putting it in the key too makes "extent" sayable in two places that can disagree. Aliases give the
  ergonomic bundling without the second source of truth.
- **Statistic not part of identity (one quantity, many cell-methods at read).** Rejected for the
  *materialized key* — `max(temp)` and `mean(temp)` must coexist in one Coverage — but reconciled: the
  **identity root** is the quantity, the **materialized key** is `(quantity, statistic)`.

## Consequences

- The **materialized key is `(quantity, statistic)`**: "instantaneous temperature" and "daily-max
  temperature" sit at different keys, not one parameter with two cell-methods.
- **Mixed *periods* of one parameter in one Coverage are not yet representable** — `precipitation` over
  1h vs 3h `valid_time` cells would need different `Cell` `bounds` for the same coordinate (a future
  **per-parameter bounds override** seam). An extent/Domain matter, not identity; v1's precipitation is
  **uniformly hourly** (one shared `valid_time` cell serves every parameter), so the override is deferred.
- The statistic vocabulary and canonical quantity set are the deferred **parameter conventions**
  ([#10](../concerns.md#10-parameter-conventions)); this ADR fixes the *structure* (quantity identity,
  `extent_scaling`, the cell axes), while the concrete quantity table, conversion edges, and their
  quality costs stay deferred (#10, [#7](../concerns.md#7-quality-scoring)).
- **Curvilinear domains** and the **sampling-kernel choice** remain interface promises / edge-deferred
  ([#12](../concerns.md#12-curvilinear-domains), [#5](../concerns.md#5-read-time-homogenization-fidelity)).
- **The model degenerates cleanly.** Unfilled slots — `present = None`, the `Uniform` / `PerParameter`
  provenance plane (`PerPoint` later), windowed `CellStatistic` (`max` / `min` / `mean`), the
  per-parameter bounds override, a **navigable Z axis** (pressure levels / 3-D columns; the surface
  bundle is the degenerate near-surface fat cell) — cost nothing, so each is purely additive. v1's
  concrete positions on these slots (including precipitation as the one `extensive` parameter) live in
  [`v1-requirements.md`](../v1-requirements.md).
